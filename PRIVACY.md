# Music Viz Privacy Policy

This application listens for any currently playing audio, or alternately for microphone audio when no music audio is detected.

As of this writing, [Play Store rules](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469#privacy) require any apps with this sort of device audio access to publish a privacy policy. As such, what follows is the privacy policy for the [Music Viz listing in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nickbp.viz):

- Network: Music Viz ("the application") does not transmit or convey any microphone or music audio ("audio information") outside of the device from which it was received.
- Storage: Any audio information collected by the application is solely stored on a temporary basis for the purposes of rendering a visualization of that audio, e.g. in graphics texture memory or in temporary memory buffers for rendering. Audio information is not stored or persisted outside of the application runtime.
- User options: In the future, the application may support storing user-specified preferences (for example, the user's preferred screen orientation, color scheme, or other display settings). The application may also support syncing user-specified preferences to a remote service. However these user-specified preferences will not involve any audio information.
